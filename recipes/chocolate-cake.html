  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Preheat oven to 180°C. Grease the base and sides of a 23cm springform
      cake tin and line with baking paper.
    </li>
    <li>
      To make the cake, in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment,
      whisk eggs and sugar for 7 minutes or until pale and tripled in size.
      Sieve flour, cocoa, baking powder and ¼ tsp fine sea salt into a bowl.
      Gently fold flour mixture into egg mixture in 2 batches. Fold in butter.
      Pour into prepared tin and bake for 35 minutes or until a skewer
      inserted in the centre comes out clean. Cool cake completely in tin,
      then remove and, using a large serrated knife, cut horizontally into
      thirds. Grease base and side of cleaned cake tin and line with baking
      paper. Place top third of cake in the base of the pan.
    </li>
    <li>
      For the pâte à bombe, combine sugar, glucose and 2 tbs water in a small
      saucepan. Bring to the boil, stirring continuously, until sugar
      dissolves, then simmer for 5 minutes or until 120°C on a sugar
      thermometer. In the cleaned stand mixer fitted with the whisk
      attachment, whisk yolks until pale. With the motor running, add sugar
      syrup in a steady stream and whisk for 10 minutes or until cooled.
      Divide evenly between 2 bowls.
    </li>
    <li>
      For milk chocolate mousse, fill a small saucepan to a third full with
      water and bring to a very gentle simmer. Place chocolate and butter in a
      small heatproof bowl, place over pan (don’t let the bowl touch the
      water) and melt without stirring. Set aside to cool. Whisk cream to
      medium peaks. Fold 1 batch pâte à bombe mixture into chocolate mixture,
      then, in 2 batches, fold in whipped cream. Chill for 2 hours to firm
      slightly.
    </li>
    <li>
      For dark chocolate mousse, fill a small saucepan to a third full with
      water and bring to a very gentle simmer. Place chocolate and butter in a
      small heatproof bowl, place over pan (don’t let the bowl touch the
      water) and melt without stirring. Set aside to cool. Whisk cream to
      medium peaks. Fold orange zest, orange oil and remaining pâte à bombe
      into chocolate mixture, then, in 2 batches, fold in whipped cream.
      Spread mousse over cake, leaving a 5mm border. Chill for 1 hour or until
      set.
    </li>
    <li>
      Top dark chocolate mousse with middle third of cake. Spread milk
      chocolate mousse over cake, leaving a 5mm border. Chill for 2 hours or
      until firm, then top with remaining cake. Chill for a further 2 hours or
      overnight to set. Transfer to a large serving plate.
    </li>
    <li>
      For chocolate glaze, soak gelatine in cold water for 5 minutes to
      soften. In a bowl, whisk cocoa and ¼ cup (60ml) water to form a smooth
      paste. Combine cream and sugar in a saucepan over medium-high heat and
      stir constantly until sugar dissolves. Squeeze excess water from
      gelatine and stir gelatine and cocoa mixture into cream mixture until
      dissolved. Pour glaze over top of cake only, allowing some to drip over
      the edge.
    </li>
  </ol>
