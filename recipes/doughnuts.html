  </p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <p>Icing</p>
  <ul>
    <li>100ml milk</li>
    <li>200gm dark chocolate</li>
    <li>2 &frac12; tablespoons whisky</li>
    <li>&frac23; cups (150gm) caster sugar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>Chopped almonds to serve</li>
    <li>Dark chocolate, shaved, to serve</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Doughnuts</p>
  <ul>
    <li>2 &frac12; teaspoons dried instant yeast</li>
    <li>&frac14; cup (60ml) milk, warmed</li>
    <li>&frac23; cup (150gm) caster sugar</li>
    <li>3 &frac14; cups (485gm) plain flour</li>
    <li>&frac23; cup (165gm) buttermilk</li>
    <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
    <li>40gm unsalted butter, melted, cooled slightly</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      For the doughnuts, combine yeast and warm milk with a pinch of sugar in
      a bowl. Set aside for 10 minutes or until frothy. Combine the flour and
      remaining sugar with a pinch of salt in the bowl of an electric mixer
      fitted with a dough hook. Gradually add the yeast mixture, buttermilk,
      egg and butter, and knead on low speed for 5 minutes or until smooth and
      elastic. Place dough in an oiled bowl (the dough will be quite wet),
      cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place for 1-1 1/2 hours
      until doubled in size.
    </li>

    <li>
      Turn out the dough onto a floured work surface and knock down. Roll into
      a sausage and cut into 10 equal-sized pieces. Roll each piece of dough
      into a smooth ball. Divide between two baking paper-lined baking trays.
      Lightly flatten each ball into a 9cm disk. Using a 3.5cm round cutter,
      cut out centres of dough and discard. Lightly cover doughnuts with oiled
      plastic wrap. Set aside in a warm place for a further 1 hour or until
      risen.
    </li>

    <li>
      Preheat the oven to 200C. Baking one tray at a time, bake the doughnuts
      for 8-9 minutes until light golden and cooked through. Remove from oven
      and transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly.
    </li>

    <li>
      Meanwhile, for the glaze, combine milk, chocolate, whisky and 1
      tablespoon sugar in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of gently simmering
      water (don’t let the bowl touch the water), stirring until melted and
      combined. Remove from heat. Cool slightly.
    </li>

    <li>
      Combine cinnamon and remaining sugar in a bowl. Wet a pastry brush with
      milk, then brush over doughnuts.
    </li>

    <li>Toss the doughnuts in sugar mixture, then dip the tops in glaze.</li>

    <li>
      Serve doughnuts warm, sprinkled with almonds and shaved chocolate, with
      any remaining glaze on the side.
    </li>
  </ol>
