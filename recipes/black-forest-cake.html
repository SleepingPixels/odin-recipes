  <h2>Black Forest Cake</h2>
  <p>
    Rich dark chocolate cake layers filled with cream and sour cherries is
    just one of the reasons why we love this easy Black Forest cake recipe.
  </p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <h4>Cake</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>400g unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>500g caster sugar</li>
    <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>6 eggs</li>
    <li>3 cups (450g) self-raising flour</li>
    <li>1 cup (150g) plain flour</li>
    <li>1 &frac12; cups (150g) cocoa powder</li>
    <li>2 tsp bicarb soda</li>
    <li>1 cup (250ml) buttermilk</li>
    <li>1 cup (250ml) milk</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Ganache Icing</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>150ml thickened cream</li>
    <li>175g dark (70%) chocolate, chopped</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Filling</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>3 tsp cornflour</li>
    <li>
      400g can sour pitted cherries, drained, juice reserved (approx. 1 cup)
    </li>
    <li>450ml thickened cream</li>
    <li>1 tbs icing sugar</li>
    <li>2 tbs kirsch</li>
    <li>Sour pitted cherries, to decorate (optional)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Preheat oven to 180°C. Lightly grease two 22cm cake tins and line the
      base and sides with baking paper.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place the butter, sugar and vanilla in a stand mixer with the paddle
      attachment and beat for 4-5 minutes until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs,
      one at a time, beating well after each addition. In a separate bowl,
      sift together flours, cocoa and bicarb soda. Combine buttermilk and milk
      in another small bowl or jug. In batches, fold flour mixture and milk
      mixture, alternating between the two, into the butter mixture until just
      combined and smooth.
    </li>
    <li>
      Divide the mixture between prepared pans, smoothing the top. Bake for
      60-65 minutes until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.
      Cool in pans for 15 minutes, before turning out on wire racks to cool
      completely.
    </li>
    <li>
      Meanwhile, for the ganache icing, place the cream in a small saucepan
      over medium heat and bring to just below boiling point. Place the
      chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Pour over the hot cream and stir until
      melted and smooth. Allow to cool slightly.
    </li>
    <li>
      For the filling, mix together cornflour and 1 tbs of the reserved cherry
      juice until combined. Place the remaining cherry juice in a small
      saucepan over medium heat, and add the cornflour mixture. Cook,
      stirring, for 2-3 minutes until thickened. Set aside to cool. Combine
      the cream and icing sugar and whisk to stiff peaks. Set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
      To assemble, trim the tops off each cooled cake and discard. Cut each
      cake in half to form two even layers, creating 4 layers of cake. Place
      one layer on a serving plate, drizzle with one-third of the kirsch and a
      little cherry syrup, then spread with one-third of the whipped cream.
      Dot with sour cherries. Repeat layering with remaining cake and
      fillings, finishing with a cake layer. Spread ganache icing over the top
      of cake and garnish with extra sour cherries, if desired.
    </li>
  </ol>
