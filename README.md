## Self Reflection
***Before*** </br>
*Start date: 11 November 2025* </br>
I am excited to get started with this project, I am a hands on learner, a tinkerer at heart and this project will help me get started in applying my learning. I feel like I have grasped the theory well, so now it is time to put it into practice. I don't have any worries or concerns at this stage, I am just excited to get started!

***After***</br>
*Finish date: 11 November 2025* </br>
I finished the project much faster than I anticipated and I am happy with my HTML progress. Completing this exercise certainly solidified knowlege about links, both internal and external. I also feel better about using attributes in the opening tags. Overall, I'm quite happy with my attempts this lesson. I have also enjoyed tinkering with the markdown syntax for this README file. 

Thanks for viewing!
