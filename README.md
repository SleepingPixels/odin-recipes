*The Odin Project: Recipes - Foundations Course*

## Description
This is the first project within The Odin Project Foundations Course and is designed to practice and solidify basic knowledge and skills of HTML. This project is solely focussed on HTML and therefore, CSS will come at a later date in a future project. 

The objective of this project is to create a recipes website as per The Odin Project's specifications.

## Self Reflection
***Before starting the project.***
I am excited to get started with this project, I am a hands on learner, a tinkerer at heart and this project will help me get started in applying my learning. I feel like I have grasped the theory well, so now it is time to put it into practice. I don't have any worries or concerns at this stage, I am just excited to get started!

*Start date: 11 November 2025*

***After finishing the project***
